<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">The three spring lambs barged into there spring collection room to see Bruce Springsteen standing there, “oh its you Bruce, I thought we were being robbed” Tim said, “No god sorry to scare you guys it’s just me, I saw no one home and I let myself in” Bruce replied, “wait what are you doing here anyway?” Colin interjected, “A spring broke on my trampoline and I came around to see if you guys would have any. luckily, I found Shaun’s spring which is perfect, I hope you don’t mind if I take it!” Bruce explained, “You certainly can of course, would you like help from us to install it?” Shaun said.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">So, with spring in hand the three spring lambs walked back with Bruce Springsteen to Bruce’s house to fix the trampoline, walking through the lovely meadow, taking in all the sights that the beautiful spring day had to offer. They all stopped for a moment beside the dirt track to take a mental picture of the breath-taking scenery before setting off again. When suddenly they heard a tremendous rumbling noise, the rumbling came from the engine of the farmers truck, with a great swiftness the farmer scooped up all the spring lambs up and threw them into the back of the truck. “Wait! What are you doing with Tim, Colin and Shaun?” Bruce yelped. “They are going to the slaughter house as it’s the end of spring, which reminders me and the missus are having a barbeque later, we are cooking lamb shanks, lamb steaks and lamb chops, will you make it around at 8?” Farmer Tom said. “That sounds delightful I wouldn’t miss it for the world, I will be around after I fix my trampoline thanks. “Mr. Springsteen said.
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">So, Bruce went home and fixed the trampoline, “YAY! I did it, I fixed the trampoline, now time to go to the barbeque” Bruce said. So, that is exactly what he did, he spent the rest of the day enjoying the fresh lamb barbeque with the company of Farmer Tom and his wife, it was a great day and the perfect ending to Spring time.
