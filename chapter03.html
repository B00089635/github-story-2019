<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">The three spring lambs barged into there spring collection room to see Bruce Springsteen standing there, “oh its you Bruce, I thought we were being robbed” Tim said, “No god sorry to scare you guys it’s just me, I saw no one home and I let myself in” Bruce replied, “wait what are you doing here anyway?” Colin interjected, “A spring broke on my trampoline and I came around to see if you guys would have any. luckily, I found Shaun’s spring which is perfect, I hope you don’t mind if I take it!” Bruce explained, “You certainly can of course, would you like help from us to install it?” Shaun said.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">So, with spring in hand the three spring lambs walked back with Bruce Springsteen to Bruce’s house to fix the trampoline, walking through the lovely meadow, taking in all the sights that the beautiful spring day had to offer. They all stopped for a moment beside the dirt track to take a mental picture of the breath-taking scenery before setting off again. When suddenly they heard a tremendous rumbling noise, they reached Bruce’s house they began work on fixing the trampoline, “YAY! We did it, we fixed the trampoline, let’s all play on it!” Bruce said. So, that is exactly what they did, they spent the rest of the day enjoying the trampoline in good company, it was a great day and the perfect ending to Spring time.</p>

<h2 style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT', Brush Script Std, cursive; text-align: center; font-size: 30px;">THE END!</h2>
