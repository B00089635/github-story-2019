<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">The house seemed barren, he couldn’t hear or see any sign of anyone being there, “There must be some springs around here somewhere” Bruce said as he began searching the house, he began searching the house from top to the bottom, no sign of springs in the kitchen, nor in the sitting room, nor in the bathroom, nor in any of the bedrooms, nor in the attic.
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">Bruce Springsteen was beginning to lose hope he would ever find the spring he needed for his trampoline and be able to enjoy the lovely spring day, so he turned to head for the door to leave with his head in his hands until he stumbled across a door labelled ‘Spring Collection Room’, Bruce’s face lit up with glee “Well that’s convenient, The Three Lambs have a room dedicated to springs, just what I need” he said. Bruce entered the room and was faced with three shelves, each holding a single spring and labelled with each of the three spring lambs names.
</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">Bruce walked up to the first shelf labelled ‘Tim’s Shelf’, he picked up the spring and pulled on it “This spring is far too tight, this will make the bounce too tight and uneven I will not be able to bounce properly on it, this will not work!” so he put the spring back. Mr. Springsteen walked up to the second shelf labelled ‘Colin’s Shelf’, he picked up the spring and pulled on it “This spring is far too loose, this will make the bounce too loose and uneven I will not be able to bounce properly on it, this will not work!” so he put the spring back. he walked up to the final shelf labelled ‘Shaun’s Shelf’, he picked up the spring and pulled on it “This spring is perfect, this will make the bounce perfect I will be able to bounce properly on it, this will not work!” so he put the spring in his pocket, suddenly he heard a creak of the door followed by a shout saying “WHO IS IN OUR HOUSE!”.
