Chapter 1 – It was a delightful, fresh, warm Spring morning in early May, the sun was shining, the birds were chirping, the flowers were such a vibrant array of colours, our story follows the eventful day of Bruce Springsteen. “Wow, is there anything better than a frolic around a Spring meadow in the early hours of this beautiful morning” he said, as he was standing in his back garden, “The only thing that could make this Spring day Better is to play on my trampoline”. So that is exactly what he did, Bruce walked over to the trampoline and began springing up and down on it, he was bouncing higher and higher, he could see well over his hedges into the surrounding fields, he could see vibrant daffodils and tulips, rabbits and squirrels playing together, the rich aroma of freshly cut grass filled the air. “This day could not get any better, enjoying the spring weather and bouncing as high as I can on my trampoline, what could beat it” Mr. Springsteen said. Bruce began jumping higher and higher and higher until suddenly, *rattle* *rattle* *SNAP*, “Oh no! one of my springs on my trampoline has broken, I can no longer play on it, maybe my neighbours will have a spare spring”. So he walked through the meadow to his neighbours house, he saw a sign saying ‘Property of the Spring Lambs’ and continued walking up the path to the door *Knock* *Knock* “Hello? Anyone home?” Bruce said, there was no reply so Bruce creaked open the door and walked in.
